    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games and artificial intelligence have long overlapped, even as the popular perception of what technologies constitute AI has shifted over time. Categories of video game AI vary from simpler behaviors like those of arcade-game enemies to more advanced state-machine approaches or even the strategic search algorithms seen in chess engines. However, as players often face off against computer-controlled opponents in these games, a question arises: in what cases can these algorithms take the role of players themselves?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research in machine learning has investigated applications of machine learning to the process of playing video games. This process is aided by the fact that video games are self-contained, easily repeatable, and can be configured to be deterministic if controlling the state of the random number generator. Within the scope of natural language processing, there has been some work on applying language models to text adventure games. Typically, these games task players with navigating around multi-room environments, locating and collecting various objects, and using these objects to solve puzzles and unlock new areas. This presents a challenging task for language models, since they have to identify these objects and interact with the environment to progress through the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jericho](https://github.com/microsoft/jericho) and [TextWorld](https://github.com/Microsoft/TextWorld) projects from Microsoft provide text-adventure environments to use with language models, and we used the former as our test bench for our models. Many classic adventure games, including Zork (our chosen environment), [are available](https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/z-machine-games) in a format compatible with Jericho."

    "## Random baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "In a prior project, we found that a model trained to play Street Fighter was actually comparable to one that just input actions randomly. Following that pattern, we chose to implement a naïve model here that simply picked random actions out of the set of possible commands. As in the Street Fighter case, this baseline model is also useful to understand how well an LLM performs at a text adventure game.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate all of our models, we track a variety of properties about the game environment as we step through:\n",
    "- Unique rooms reached\n",
    "- Unique items gathered\n",
    "- Unique game states (hashes)\n",
    "- Score (as reported by the game)\n",
    "- Average moves (\"retries\") between increases in score\n",
    "\n",
    "Many classic text adventure games use a custom Z-Machine language. This allowed games to be programmed once and then run on many different computers using platform-specific interpreters, thereby drastically reducing the complexity of porting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jericho incorporates a Z-Machine interpreter called Frotz to run these games. Using this library, let's run our random agent through 100 turns of Zork to see how it performs:"

    "Starting simple, we chose to assess the ability of off-the-shelf open-weight models to play Zork. We start with LLaMa3.2 1b and 3b as the language model acting as the player. Our first strategy simply provides a system prompt informing the model that it is playing a text adventure game, then prompts the model with the game’s scenario description for a response, which is fed back into the game as an action to take. This is intentionally naive, and the results reflect it. The model is inconsistent with the format and validity of the actions it gives. If a valid action is “open mailbox”, model responses could vary from “mail” to “As the player, you should type: open the mailbox and read its contents”. Neither of these are recognized by the game; however a human player could make these same mistakes when learning how commands are written."

    "We then take a more direct approach to fix the validity of commands. Jericho provides the `env.get_valid_actions()` function that returns a list of valid actions for the current game state (player location, inventory, etc.). We chose to include this list of actions in the model’s prompt to give it options to choose from. This felt like cheating at first because figuring out the correct commands is part of the gameplay experience of a text adventure game, and ideally we would like to see the model “learn” to play like a human would. The problem is that the only ways we know of to fix the model’s action outputs are providing the commands like this, training or fine-tuning the model to be better at generating commands, or trying a model other than LLaMa that might have more experience with these types of games. We explore both of these other options later."

    "Providing valid actions is another step in the right direction, as it does make the model much more consistent at using valid commands. It still would use an invalid command at times, but it was able to fix its mistake more often by noticing its chosen command wasn’t in the list. The problem this revealed is that the model’s valid commands are still not necessarily commands that move the game forward. It’s common in this setup that the model will choose to open the mailbox, take the leaflet, put the leaflet in the mailbox, then repeat the process, or move in random cardinal directions without ever discovering the way into the house. Even when we tell it that its goal is to complete the game, it does not seem to know what that entails, and does not have any sort of “curiosity” to motivate in-depth exploration of the environment."

      "First, I should recall the possible actions. The user previously used the view_possible_actions function and got options like open mailbox, north, south, west. Since I already opened the mailbox, maybe the next step is to check other directions. The leaflet might be a clue, but maybe I need to go somewhere else first. Let me think about the game's typical structure. Usually, in Zork, you might need to go into the house, but the door is boarded. Maybe I need to find another way in or check other locations. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet has a message that tells me where to go. But since I haven't read the leaflet yet, perhaps I should check that. Wait, the game might require me to pick up the leaflet first. Let me check if there's a 'take' action available. But in the initial possible actions, it wasn't listed. Maybe I need to use the view_possible_actions again to see what's available now. Wait, the user tried opening the mailbox, and the response was the leaflet. So maybe the next step is to take the leaflet. But the possible actions might not include 'take' unless the game allows it. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue that tells me to go north, south, or west. Let me think. In the original Zork, the mailbox might lead to a clue that tells you to go north to the house, but the door is boarded. Maybe I need to find a way to open the door. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a key item. Let me try to take the leaflet. But the possible actions might not include 'take' unless the game allows it. Wait, the initial possible actions were open mailbox, north, south, west. So perhaps after opening the mailbox, the possible actions might change. Let me check again by using view_possible_actions. But the user already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to go north towards the house. Let me try moving north. But the door is boarded, so maybe I can't enter yet. Alternatively, maybe there's another object to interact with. Wait, the user hasn't checked the other directions. Let me try moving north first. So, the action would be 'north'. Let me try that.\n",

Maybe there's a mistake in the tool calls. Wait, the user might have tried to go north, then perhaps tried another action that brought them back. Alternatively, maybe the game state is stuck, but that's unlikely. The correct path is to go north from West of House to North of House, then maybe proceed further. Since the user is back at West of House, perhaps they need to go north again. Let me check the previous steps. The user did go north once, but maybe they need to continue moving north from there. Alternatively, maybe they need to check other directions. But the initial steps suggest that the mailbox is here, and the north direction leads to the path. So the next logical step is to go north again. Let me confirm the possible actions again. The available actions are open mailbox, north, south, west. Since the user has already opened the mailbox, the next step should be to go north. So the correct action here is to go north again.

Let me think about the game's typical structure. Usually, in Zork, you might need to go into the house, but the door is boarded. Maybe I need to find another way in or check other locations. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet has a message that tells me where to go. But since I haven't read the leaflet yet, perhaps I should check that. Wait, the game might require me to pick up the leaflet first. Let me check if there's a 'take' action available. But in the initial possible actions, it wasn't listed. Maybe I need to use the view_possible_actions again to see what's available now. Wait, the user tried opening the mailbox, and the response was the leaflet. So maybe the next step is to take the leaflet. But the possible actions might not include 'take' unless the game allows it. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue that tells me to go north, south, or west. Let me think. In the original Zork, the mailbox might lead to a clue that tells you to go north to the house, but the door is boarded. Maybe I need to find a way to open the door. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a key item. Let me try to take the leaflet. But the possible actions might not include 'take' unless the game allows it.

We do acknowledge that memorizing the game is a valid strategy to complete the game, but it would be much more interesting if we could show that a model can be coerced to use logic to make choices and progress in the game. Below, we take the very first message shown to the player by Zork, truncate it around halfway through, and task each model with completing the text. Our assumption is that the more similar the embeddings of the generated text are to the embeddings of the actual text, the more likely that the model has prior experience with the game."

Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a fine-tuning method for LLMs, notably used by DeepSeek to train their reasoning models. This approach simplifies Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by removing the value and reward models from the equation.\n",

    "Applying GRPO on top of a previously fine-tuned model did marginally improve performance. However, its effectiveness was still limited. One potential reason is that, unlike the training process models using a framework like Gymnasium might undergo, the space of possible situations the model might be in is still constrained by an input dataset. One potential mitigation is to explore the world further than what the walkthrough describes.\n",

    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring issue with language models is that it can be more difficult for them to “connect the dots” between different observations over the course of the game. Additionally, game worlds can be quite large in size, to the extent where the context size may not be sufficient to capture what information is specifically relevant to a scenario the model encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential avenue to address these deficiencies is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which allows a model to search a vector database to find documents similar to a set of keywords. These similarities are computed based on embeddings generated by a separate model. RAG can be further augmented into a graph-based system that allows links between individual documents. This allows more complex relationships to be described, which is useful in this task. For example, edges can describe pathways between locations or objects contained within.\n",

To combat this, we try separating turns into multiple steps, similar to the added “analyze” step used with an earlier strategy. This is also a similar approach to Q*BERT, which uses a question-answer dataset. This paradigm of asking the model pointed questions related to its goal, and feeding the answers back to the model for its final inference forms a sort of “Chain of Thought” (https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) and is a common strategy for prompt engineering to improve model performance.\n",

However, we would be remiss if we didn't try a larger model. We chose to try GPT-5.2 through OpenAI's API. It is advertised as highly productive model for agentic workflows and task completion. We found that it made it farther through the game than anything else, achieving a score of 40/350 at the highest compared to the rest of the models, which only achieved as high as 15/350. While ChatGPT did make it farther, there was a lot of game left to play and it still either died to the thief or got stuck in a loop of actions somewhere underground."
