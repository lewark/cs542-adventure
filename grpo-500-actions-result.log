You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.

> N
North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.


> N
Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.


> U
Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.


> Get egg
Taken.


> D
Forest Path


> S
North of House


> E
Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.


> Open window
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.


> W
Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water


> Open sack
Opening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.


> Get garlic
Taken.


> W
Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.


> Get lamp
Taken.


> E
Kitchen
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
There is a brown sack here.
The brown sack contains:

> U
You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.


> Light lamp
The brass lantern is now on.

Attic
This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.
A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.
On a table is a nasty-looking knife.


> Get rope
Taken.


> Get knife

> D

There was no verb in that sentence!


> Drop sack
Dropped.


> Move sword
You aren't an accomplished enough juggler.


> Move rug
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door.


> Open trapdoor
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.


> D
You have moved into a dark place.
The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.


> Light lamp
The brass lantern is now on.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.


> N
The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.


> Kill troll with sword
The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.


> Drop egg
Dropped.


> E
East-West Passage
This is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room.


> E
Round Room
This is a circular stone room with passages in all directions. Several of them have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.


> Se
Engravings Cave
You have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.
There are old engravings on the walls here.


> E
Dome Room
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.


> Tie rope to railing
The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.


> D
Torch Room
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.
A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.
Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.


> Douse lamp
The brass lantern is now off.


> Get torch
Taken.


> D
Temple
This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.
There is a brass bell here.


> S
Altar
This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.
On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.


> Drop sword
Dropped.


> Get book
Taken.


> N
Temple
There is a brass bell here.


> Get bell
Taken.


> E
Egyptian Room
This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending staircase to the west.
The solid-gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.


> Open coffin
The gold coffin opens.
A sceptre, possibly that of ancient Egypt itself, is in the coffin. The sceptre is ornamented with colored enamel, and tapers to a sharp point.


> Get sceptre

Entrance to Hades
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

  Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.


> D
You can't go that way.


> U
You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.


> N
Mirror Room
You are in a large square room with tall ceilings. On the south wall is an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall. There are exits on the other three sides of the room.


> Touch mirror
You have moved into a dark place.
There is a rumble from deep within the earth and the room shakes.


> E
Oh, no! A lurking grue slithered into the room and devoured you!
 
   ****  You have died  **** 

As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed. The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even unreal.
