Typically, in Zork, to start you might \"look\" or \"north\" or \"east\". The user hasn't given a command; maybe they want us to play the game? The instructions say we must choose an action that will make progress. So we should pick a likely starting action: \"look\" to see details. But \"look\" is default; but we can also \"go east\" to go to the house. The typical first action is to \"go east\". Let's see what is at east: \"You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.\" So moving east leads to inside? Actually, east would be toward the house, but the door is boarded. So we can \"go east\" and then \"look\". But the board may block. But we can \"look\". I think the first action should be \"go east\". Let's do that.\n",

      "Thinking:  We are at the starting location, \"West of House\". Need to find ways to progress. Standard opening of Zork: you need to go north to the \"west of house\" etc. Actually starting location is West of House, you can go east to the house, but door is boarded. You need to find a key, etc. Common solution: go north, get the key from the mailbox, go north to get a key, etc. The standard path: Go north, you get to a \"north of house\" area with a key inside mailbox. But you can't open mailbox until you have the key? Wait, the mailbox might contain a letter. But the key to the front door is somewhere else: \"A key is hidden under the mat.\" Actually, the key is hidden in the \"stool\" or something. Let's recall Zork opening: You are at the \"West of House\". You can go north to a \"north of house\" location, which is a \"north of house\" (a small path). Then you can go east to \"east of house\" etc. Actually, let's recall: In Zork, the first key is found inside a mailbox. Wait, the mailbox contains a note, but you need a key to open the mailbox? Or to open the door? Let's think: In Zork, the mailbox is under a small door, you can open it with a key? I think you need to find the key. The key is hidden under a stone or in a box in the \"north of house\". Alternatively, you can pick up a key by using \"open mailbox\" maybe. But the first key is under a small mailbox on the west of house. Actually, the standard solution: Go north, go east, pick up a key. But I'm not sure.\n",
