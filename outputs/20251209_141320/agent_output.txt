West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.


Thinking:  Okay, let's see. I'm playing Zork I, and I'm at the starting point: West of House. The description says there's a small mailbox here. The goal is to finish the game, so I need to figure out what steps to take.

First, I should check what actions are possible here. The user mentioned using the view_possible_actions function. Let me call that to see the available options. Common actions in such games usually include looking around, checking objects, and interacting with them. Since there's a mailbox, maybe I can open it or check its contents. Also, the front door is boarded, so perhaps I need to break it or find a key. But first, let's see what the game allows.

Using view_possible_actions will give me the list. Then I can choose an action like 'open mailbox' or 'go east' if there's a direction. Wait, the initial location is west of the house. Maybe there are directions like north, south, east, west. But the user hasn't mentioned other rooms yet. Let me check the possible actions first.

Result: open mailbox, north, south, west
Thinking:  Okay, so I'm at the West of House location. The possible actions are open mailbox, north, south, west. Let me think about each of these.

First, the mailbox is mentioned in the description, so opening it might be useful. Maybe there's a key or something inside. Let me try opening the mailbox first. If that doesn't work, I can check the other directions.

But wait, the user is standing west of the house. The directions north, south, and west might lead to different areas. However, in many Zork games, the initial area has limited movement. For example, going west might lead to a dead end, or perhaps there's a path elsewhere. But since the possible actions include those directions, I should consider them.

However, the mailbox is a specific object here. Since the game often requires interacting with objects before moving, maybe opening the mailbox is the first step. Let me try that. If I open the mailbox, maybe I find a key that's needed to break the door or access another area. Alternatively, if there's nothing, then I can proceed to check the directions.

So the next action should be to open the mailbox. Let's execute that.

Content:  
Calling do_game_action with arguments {'action': 'open mailbox'}
Result: Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.


Thinking:  Okay, so I opened the mailbox and found a leaflet. Now I need to figure out what to do next. The leaflet might have some information or a clue. Let me check the possible actions again to see if there's anything else I can do here. The previous possible actions were open mailbox, north, south, west. Since I already opened the mailbox, maybe the next steps involve reading the leaflet or moving in a direction.

Wait, the leaflet might be a clue about the house or the key. Maybe the leaflet tells me where to find a key or how to proceed. Alternatively, maybe I need to go to the house and break the door. But the door is boarded, so perhaps I need a tool. Let me check if there's a key in the leaflet. If the leaflet has a key, then I can use it to open the door. If not, maybe I need to explore other directions.

Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a map or a note that tells me to go in a certain direction. Let me think. In Zork I, the standard approach is to find a key, break the door, and proceed. Since the mailbox was the first place, maybe the key is here. But I need to check if the leaflet has a key. If not, perhaps I need to go north or south. Let me check the possible actions again. The possible actions were open mailbox, north, south, west. Since I already did open mailbox, maybe the next step is to go north or south. But I need to see if there's a key. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue to go east, but east isn't in the initial possible actions. Wait, maybe after opening the mailbox, the game allows other actions. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's current location is West of House. The possible actions are open mailbox, north, south, west. So maybe after opening the mailbox, the next step is to go east towards the house. But the door is boarded, so maybe I need to break it. However, breaking the door might require a tool. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet has a key. Let me check the leaflet's content. Since the game's response just says "Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet," I need to check if there's a key in it. If the leaflet has a key, then I can take it and use it to open the door. If not, maybe I need to proceed to the house and break the door. Let me try to take the leaflet first. Wait, but the game might not allow taking the leaflet unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue. Let me think. In Zork I, the standard path is to find a key in the mailbox, then go to the house, break the door with the key, and proceed. So perhaps the leaflet is the key. Let me check if the leaflet is the key. If I take the leaflet, maybe it's the key. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a note that tells me to go to the house. Let me try to take the leaflet. Wait, the game might not have a 'take' action unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue to go east. Let me try to go east. But the initial possible actions don't include east. Wait, the initial possible actions are north, south, west. Maybe after opening the mailbox, the game allows moving east. Let me try to go east. But how? The possible actions might have changed. Alternatively, maybe I need to check the directions again. Let me check the possible actions again. The user's previous response showed that the possible actions are open mailbox, north, south, west. So maybe after opening the mailbox, the next step is to go north or south. Let me try going north. If that's a dead end, then try south. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is the key. Let me check the leaflet's content. Since the game's response doesn't provide more info, perhaps the leaflet is the key. So I can use it to open the door. But how? Maybe the key is in the leaflet. Let me try to use the key. Wait, but I need to have the key first. So perhaps the leaflet is the key. Let me try to take the leaflet. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the leaflet is a clue to go to the house. Let me try to go east. But the initial possible actions don't include east. Wait, maybe after opening the mailbox, the game allows moving east. Let me try that. So the next action would be to go east. But how? The possible actions are open mailbox, north, south, west. So maybe I need to check if there's a key in the mailbox. Wait, I already opened the mailbox and found the leaflet. So maybe the leaflet is the key. Let me try to use it. But how?

So after opening the mailbox, maybe the next step is to go north or south. Let me try going north. If that's a dead end, then try south. Let me try going north first.

Calling do_game_action with arguments {'action': 'north'}
Result: North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.


Thinking:  Okay, let me think. I'm now at the North of House. The description says there's no door here, all windows are boarded, and a narrow path goes through the trees to the north. The possible actions here might include going north along the path, but I need to check what's available.

Wait, the user's previous action was going north from the West of House, which led to this new location. Now, the possible actions here might be to go north further, or maybe other directions. But since I'm at the north side, maybe the path north is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to go back south or west. But the goal is to find a way into the house. Since the front door is boarded, maybe the key is needed. Earlier, I found a leaflet in the mailbox. Maybe the leaflet has a key, or perhaps the path north leads to another location with a key.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the possible actions again. Let me use the view_possible_actions function to see what's available here. The previous possible actions were open mailbox, north, south, west. Now, being at North of House, the possible actions might include going north, south (back), or maybe other directions. Let me check.

Content:  
Calling view_possible_actions with arguments {}
Result: east, north, west
Thinking:  Okay, so I'm at the North of House, and the possible actions are east, north, west. Let me think. The user is facing the north side of the house, with a path winding through the trees to the north. The possible directions are east, north, west. But how does that work? If I'm at the north side, going east might take me back towards the original West of House location, or maybe to another area. Going north along the path could lead to a new location. West might be back to where I came from.

Wait, the previous location was West of House. When I went north from there, I ended up at North of House. Now, from here, the possible actions are east, north, west. So going east might take me back to the West of House, but that's where I started. Alternatively, maybe going west from here would take me back to the original location. But I need to find a way to get into the house. Since the front door is boarded, maybe I need a key. Earlier, I found a leaflet in the mailbox. Maybe the leaflet is the key, or perhaps there's another key in the path north.

Let me try going north first. If I go north along the path, maybe I'll find something. Alternatively, maybe the path leads to a location with a key. Let me try that. So the next action would be to go north.

Content:  
Calling do_game_action with arguments {'action': 'north'}
Result: Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.


Thinking:  Okay, so I'm now on the Forest Path. The description says the path goes north-south, and there's a large tree with low branches at the edge. The possible actions here might include going north or south, or maybe interacting with the tree. Since the tree has low branches, maybe there's something to climb or pick. Alternatively, maybe there's a key or item hidden there.

Let me check the possible actions again. The previous possible actions were east, north, west. Now, being on the Forest Path, the possible actions might be north, south, or interacting with the tree. Let me use the view_possible_actions function to confirm.

Content:  
Calling view_possible_actions with arguments {}
Result: up, go around forest, north, south, west, east
Thinking:  Okay, so now the possible actions are up, go around forest, north, south, west, east. The tree has low branches, so "up" might be climbing the tree. "Go around forest" could be a direction, but since the path is north-south, maybe going around would take me back. Alternatively, maybe there's an item on the tree. Let me think. In Zork I, sometimes climbing a tree can lead to finding a key or item. Let me try going up first. If that doesn't work, maybe check the other directions.

Alternatively, maybe the tree has a key. So the action "up" might be the way to get it. Let me try that.

Content:  
Calling do_game_action with arguments {'action': 'up'}
Result: Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.
