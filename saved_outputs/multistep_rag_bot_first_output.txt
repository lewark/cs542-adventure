You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

Available Tools:
- Inventory: Broken clockwork canary, bird's nest, and pile of leaves, still being carried.
- Observation: Ability to see if winding up the canary will trigger any mechanism that unlocks the grate or gains access to the white house.

As I wind up the canary's mainspring, I notice that its eyes are glowing with a faint blue light... The machinery beneath it is whirring and humming now. It seems that winding it up has triggered something!
